## Work tracking
Use the live **status:**, **priority:** and **complexity:** labels above; **Assignees** identifies the owner. These labels are separate from the task/ticket type.

**Planning complexity:** L - Python and native ML dependency/model packaging across operating systems.
Complexity is a provisional scope/uncertainty estimate, not a delivery-time commitment. XL work must be split into executable subtasks before starting.
**Planning priority:** P0 - Architecture/foundation work that unblocks the implementation path.

## Outcome
Package the current text-embedding service for PDF/YouTube reference retrieval as a managed local process with its full CPU-capable runtime/model resources.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Lock complete Python dependencies and package native libraries per target OS/architecture; no user pip/Python setup.
- [ ] Bundle pinned model/tokenizer/config resources and preserve the existing 384-dimensional vector contract.
- [ ] Load baseline resources from verified local paths without Hub fallback downloads blocking local startup.
- [ ] Verify text/PDF/existing-transcript-text contracts (speech-to-text is deferred) and CPU operation; optional acceleration must not require manual setup.
- [ ] Expose loopback readiness/shutdown and route user files through authenticated local paths or URLs.

## Architecture constraints
The complete existing Next.js UI and Express backend run locally with a local database/files. Desktop and local browser use the same localhost backend. Real third-party integrations may use the internet; preserve them wherever feasible. No central Dozu backend, cloud database, synchronization, shared publisher secrets in installers, or simulated replacements. All existing pages remain in scope; explicit v1 capability deferrals in the 2026-11-11 amendment below apply.

## User-approved v1 scope amendment — 2026-11-11

- Remove local speech-to-text from this version: no whisper.cpp server, tiny speech model, speech startup/readiness gate or speech-only assets. Retain independent media playback and genuine existing YouTube transcript text retrieval. Preserve source/page inventory; no fake transcript or new cloud STT fallback.
- Keep PostgreSQL; **defer pgvector**. A private relational cluster, reviewed migrations/seeds, persistence and data-safe upgrades remain required. Current vector(384), `<=>` and HNSW consumers need explicit reviewed adaptation; do not blindly run vector-dependent migrations, discard data or replace PostgreSQL.
- The measured 479.729 MB MiniLM snapshot is a separate **text-embedding model**, used by retained PDF/YouTube reference search and ingestion. The user's condition for dropping its experiment is not met: keep smaller-runtime/quantization proof scoped to these consumers. No working smaller runtime or pgvector-free ranking implementation is claimed.
- Ordinary PostgreSQL array/JSONB vector storage plus bounded application-side cosine ranking is an evaluation candidate only. Prove owner/topic filtering, 384-value shape, ranking/topK/ties, persistence/migration, quality and realistic scale/resource budgets before adopting it. Semantic reference retrieval has not been deferred by this decision.
- Exclude FFmpeg only when its sole consumer is deferred speech-to-text; separately prove any retained non-STT need. Keep required document/URL/PDF/editor/media/font/browser resources. OS/CPU/installers, 250 MB installer/750 MB installed and memory/startup targets remain unchanged. Payments remain deferred under #41; classrooms remain LAN.
